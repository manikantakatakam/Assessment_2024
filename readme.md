# Node.js Server Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the Node.js server implemented to manage products in a MongoDB database. The server exposes CRUD operations via HTTP endpoints.

## Server Implementation
The server is built using Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, is used to interact with the MongoDB database.

## Endpoints
The server provides the following endpoints:

- **GET /products**: Retrieves all products from the database.
- **GET /products/:id**: Retrieves a specific product by its ID.
- **POST /products**: Creates a new product in the database.
- **PUT /products/:id**: Updates an existing product by its ID.
- **DELETE /products/:id**: Deletes a product from the database by its ID.

## Testing Approach
The server's functionality is thoroughly tested using the Mocha testing framework in combination with Chai for assertions.

### Test Cases
- Positive and negative test cases cover various scenarios for each endpoint.
- Edge cases and error handling are included to ensure robustness.

### Test Execution
1. **Setup**: The project is initialized as a Node.js project using npm.
2. **Dependencies**: Necessary dependencies including Express, Mongoose, Mocha, and Chai are installed.
3. **Execution**: Tests are run using the command `npm test`.
4. **Observation**: Test results are observed to ensure all tests pass successfully.

### Additional Testing
Optional additional test cases may be added to enhance test coverage, covering edge cases and additional functionalities.

## Running Tests
To run the tests:
1. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Run `npm test`.
4. Review test results to verify functionality.

## Notes
- MongoDB connection string should be configured according to the environment.
- Replace placeholder values (e.g., product IDs) with actual data for accurate testing.
